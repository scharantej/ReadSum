### Flask App Design for Aggregating and Summarizing Articles

### I. HTML Files

1. **index.html**:
   - Purpose: Entry point of the application, contains the user interface to interact with.
   - Content:
     - HTML structure with header, body, and footer sections.
     - Form with a text input field for users to submit topics.
     - Button for users to submit the topic for article aggregation.
     - Div element with id to display the summarized results.

2. **results.html**:
   - Purpose: Displays the results of the article aggregation and summarization.
   - Content:
     - HTML structure with header, body, and footer sections.
     - Table to display the aggregated articles.
     - Div element to display the summarized text.

### II. Routes:

1. **Homepage/Root Route ('/')**:
   - HTTP Method(s): GET
   - Purpose: Displays the index.html page with the user interface.
   - Function:
     - Return the rendered index.html file.

2. **Aggregate and Summarize ('/aggregate')**:
   - HTTP Method(s): POST
   - Purpose: Accepts a topic from the user and aggregates articles related to it, then summarizes the articles.
   - Function:
     - Retrieve the topic from the request.
     - Utilize Flask's request object to access the submitted form data.
     - Fetch articles related to the topic.
     - Apply text summarization techniques to extract a summary from the articles.
     - Prepare the results as a dictionary with the topic, articles, and summary as keys.
     - Render the results.html file with the results dictionary.

### III. Implementation Details

- Utilize a Python library or API for article fetching, such as the News API.
- Implement text summarization using a suitable Python library or summarization algorithm.
- Store the summarized results in an in-memory data structure like a dictionary.
- Use Flask's `render_template()` function to render the HTML files with the data.

### IV. Additional Considerations

- Implement error handling to gracefully address potential issues like invalid topics or network errors during article retrieval.
- Utilize CSS and JavaScript for styling and interactive elements on the web pages.
- Consider integrating with a database if the application needs to store user information or persist data beyond the current session.
